# bachelors-thesis
A repository to include my bachelor's thesis (for now, only in italian) and the slides used for the presentation.
In my thesis experience I work for the FirstLife European project, a civic social network that aims to create a collaborative environment among citizens and support their initiatives. The main goal is to integrate in FirstLife a new component, that allows to introduce and implement gamification dynamics and mechanisms in a highly customizable way. Enriching the platform experience and services, It will be possible to incentivize certain desired actions and thus train active users also in complex mechanisms, such as collaborations with other citizens or creating new contents and initiatives.
